## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- pandas
- numpy
- plotly (express)
- seaborn & matplotlib (optional)

## 📈 Visualizations

Key visualizations created include:

- **Line plots** showing calls per month and rolling averages by Reason.
- **Box plots** comparing daily call volume distributions across call types.
- **Bar chart** of total calls by Reason.
- **Heatmaps** showing hourly call patterns across days of the week.
- **Pivot tables** for hourly and daily breakdowns.
- **Cluster heatmaps** for multivariate pattern discovery.
